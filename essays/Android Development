I am most comfetable in making android apps as I have more experience in android development compared to any other development.
This development skill was first learnt in my second year of degree where the assignment proposed was to make an android app.
Over time I did more projects related to android development such as doing my final year project which was an android based app. 
Also going to lots of other competitions in university I familiarized my self with the android development concepts such as the life cycle
and how to develop based on that. I also learnt how to connect databases onto the app such as Firebase.
