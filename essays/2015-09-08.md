I learnt this language by starting off with an assignment in the second year of my degree. learning this language 
is a fantastic way to write software. Itâ€™s a safe, fast, and interactive programming language. The compiler is optimized for performance and the language is optimized for development.

Swift is friendly to new programmers. Writing Swift code in a playground lets you experiment with code and see the results immediately which is perfect for just practicing, without having to build and running an app.
