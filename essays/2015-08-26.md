I have been coding in java since level 1 of my degree. Throught my entire degree I used java in many different assignments where I had to build simple systems like transport system in my first year but these skills then improved when I started doing projects and other assignments in level 2. i learnt most of my java skills through android development and my internship at Airtel Tanzania.  

I hope to learn a lot more throughout my development phase. As this is just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer.
